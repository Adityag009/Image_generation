# Image_generation


### Description
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks dedicated to image generation models, focusing on image-to-image transformation and image inpainting techniques. These notebooks utilize various models from the Hugging Face library and demonstrate their application on both local machines with GPU support and on Kaggle's GPU environment.

### Notebooks
### 1. Image-to-Image Diffusion Models
This notebook explores diffusion models for image-to-image generation tasks. The models can be executed with GPU support to enhance processing speed.

### 2. InstructPix2Pix
This notebook implements the InstructPix2Pix model, a variant of the popular Pix2Pix model that is tailored for specific instruction-based image generation tasks.

### 3. Stable Diffusion Image Variations
Explore the capabilities of Stable Diffusion to generate variations of input images, showcasing the flexibility of generative models in creating diverse outputs from a single source image.

### 4. Image Inpainting
Dedicated to demonstrating various image inpainting models. This notebook allows you to "fill in" parts of images with plausible textures and details, based on the surrounding image context.
